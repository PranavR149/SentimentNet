# Project Description
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie reviews dataset, employing various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures such as Vanilla RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The dataset contains movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative, and the reviews were preprocessed by converting them to lowercase, removing special characters and stop words, and tokenizing the text. The Keras Tokenizer was used to transform the most frequent words into integer sequences, which were then padded to a consistent length of 256 for uniform input.

After preprocessing, the dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the models. Several RNN variants were trained and tested to predict sentiment, with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, weight decay, and dropout adjusted to optimize model performance. Each model's performance was assessed based on training, validation, and test accuracy.

Among the tested models, the LSTM variant performed the best, achieving a test accuracy of 86.73%. This result highlights the strength of LSTMs in capturing long-term dependencies in text data, demonstrating the potential of RNNs in sentiment analysis tasks. Additionally, the project underscores the importance of hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance for natural language processing tasks.
